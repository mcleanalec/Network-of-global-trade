# Network-of-global-trade
Using the Harvard Center for International Development data, the network of global trade will visualized and then the most central countries in the network will be calculated. 

This projected was part of the fall 2015 Applied Data Science networks project. For this project I worked with Diego Garzon and Eren Con.
